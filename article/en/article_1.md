##### Blood pressure refers to the force exerted by blood against the walls of your arteries as it is circulated by your heart. It is usually measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and presented as two numbers:

1. Systolic Pressure: This is the higher number, indicating the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats and pumps blood into them.
2. Diastolic Pressure: This is the lower number, showing the pressure in your arteries when your heart is at rest between beats.

##### The significance of these numbers is as follows:

1. Normal Blood Pressure: A typical normal blood pressure reading is around 120/80 mm Hg, with the systolic pressure being 120 mm Hg and the diastolic pressure being 80 mm Hg.
2. Low Blood Pressure (Hypotension): Low blood pressure is defined as consistently having a reading below 90/60 mm Hg. It can lead to symptoms such as dizziness, fainting, and fatigue.
3. High Blood Pressure (Hypertension): High blood pressure, or hypertension, is when the blood pressure is consistently above 130/80 mm Hg. This condition can result in serious health issues.

##### How is blood pressure measured?

* It's important to measure blood pressure more than once because it fluctuates over the course of the day.
It can also change due to things like physical exertion, stress, pain, or extreme heat or cold. But this kind of increase in blood pressure is only temporary and it soon returns to normal.

* So, if blood pressure is measured just once and found to be high, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's always too high.
A blood pressure reading taken at the doctorâ€™s office can also be misleading: Going to the doctor makes some people so nervous that their blood pressure goes up.
So to get reliable readings, blood pressure is measured on several different days and while you are resting.
This means sitting down and relaxing on a chair, and waiting about three minutes before taking a measurement so that your circulatory system comes to rest. The upper arm that is being used for the measurement should rest on a table, at about the same height as the heart, while the reading is being done.

* You can measure your blood pressure on your own using a digital blood pressure monitor for automated readings or an instrument called a sphygmomanometer for manual readings.
