##### Introduction
* Hypertension is a common health issue that increases the risk of heart disease and stroke over time. Besides medication, exercise is an important method for controlling blood pressure. This article will briefly explore how exercise helps manage blood pressure.

##### How Exercise Affects Blood Pressure
1. Enhancing Cardiovascular Health：Aerobic exercises like walking, running, cycling, and swimming can improve heart and blood vessel health, reducing blood pressure. Engaging in 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week can significantly improve blood pressure levels.

2. Weight Reduction：Exercise helps reduce weight, which is a crucial factor in controlling blood pressure. Losing 5-10% of body weight can have a significant positive impact on blood pressure.

3. Reducing Stress：Exercise can release endorphins, helping to alleviate stress. Reduced stress decreases the release of stress hormones, which in turn helps lower blood pressure.

##### Recommended Types of Exercise
1. Aerobic Exercise：Activities like walking, running, cycling, and swimming are effective in lowering blood pressure. It is recommended to engage in 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week.

2. Strength Training：Performing full-body strength training twice a week can help lower blood pressure and improve muscle strength and endurance.

3. Flexibility and Stretching Exercises：Activities like yoga and tai chi not only improve flexibility but also reduce stress, indirectly helping to control blood pressure.

##### Conclusion
* Exercise is an effective way to control blood pressure. Through aerobic exercise, strength training, and flexibility exercises, cardiovascular health can be enhanced, weight reduced, and stress alleviated, thereby lowering and managing blood pressure levels. Combined with a healthy diet and lifestyle, exercise can be a crucial part of preventing and controlling hypertension.
